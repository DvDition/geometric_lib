# Description
### This library has been made in order to provide the ability to use helpful functions which are connected to geometric figures.

# Math formulas
## Area
- Circle: S = πR²
- Rectangle: S = ab
- Square: S = a²
- Triangle: S = (a + b + c) / 2

## Perimeter
- Circle: P = 2πR
- Rectangle: P = 2a + 2b
- Square: P = 4a

# Available functions
## Circle
- area(r) - To calculate the area of a circle, where "r" is a radius (e.g. area(4) --> 16 * pi)
- perimeter(r) - To calculate the circumference, where "r" is a radius (e.g. perimeter(5) --> 10 * pi)

## Square
- area(a) - To calculate the area of a square, where "a" is its side (e.g. area(3) --> 9)
- perimeter(a) - To calculate the perimeter of a square, where "a" is its side (e.g. perimeter(10) --> 40)
